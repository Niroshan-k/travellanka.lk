    <h1>Introduction of wild life in Sri Lanka</h1>
    <p>Sri Lanka’s wildlife is as varied as the island itself, ranging from elephants and leopards to marine life and a vast number of different birds, and Sri Lanka is now one of the best places in the world to see whales, including the mighty blue whale. With 12% of the country designated for wildlife protection, it is easy to get a taste of Sri Lankan wildlife: safari parks and sanctuaries, particularly in the southern and central zones, offer the easiest way to see animals in their natural habitat. Stay alert for a sighting of the endangered leopard; take your time as you watch the elephants feeding and washing in a tank or lagoon, or walk quietly along the beaches of the west and south coast near to marine turtles as they lay their eggs.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h2>Birds of Sri Lanka</h2>
    <p>Birdwatching in Sri Lanka is a delight for birders. The island’s isolation and tropical climate are responsible for attracting an incredibly diverse range of birds of more than 400 species. Almost 200 migrant species descend&nbsp;on the country each year having flown south for the winter, and there are 33 endemic birds in Sri Lanka. For more information, see our page on </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h2>Mammals</h2>
    <p>102 terrestrial mammals have so far been discovered on the island. 90 of them are indigenous species, of which 14 are endemic to Sri Lanka. Mammals are extensively distributed in the country due to the diverse climate, vegetation, altitude and geographic history of the island. Many travellers come to Sri Lanka hoping to see elephants, the island’s most iconic animal – visit one of the national parks and see them moving in herds in the wild, or visit the Millennium Elephant Foundation to learn more about the role elephants play in Sri Lankan culture. Sri Lanka’s elusive leopard can be seen at many national parks, most notably Yala National Park, which has the highest population density of leopards in the world. Go to tranquil Wilpattu for a sloth bear sighting, or see toque macaque, grey langur and purple-faced leaf monkeys when you meet the monkeys of Polonnaruwa.</p>

    <h2>Marine Life</h2>
    <p>Sri Lanka’s oceans also boast a wide range of spectacular creatures, including whales and dolphins, dugongs, sting rays, eels, whale sharks and five species of endangered marine turtle, as well as various colourful tropical fish and intricate, mesmerising corals. Go on a whale and dolphin watching expedition in search of the mighty blue whale, or watch as a turtle lays its eggs in the sand before returning to the sea.</p>
    <p>Why not try a wildlife holiday in Sri Lanka? The island’s astonishing diversity of landscape and the incredible range of animals that have made their home here means that there are wildlife events happening all year round. Red Dot have put together several wildlife-focused itineraries which highlight Sri Lanka’s main wildlife attractions and take you to some of the most beautiful areas of the island. These itineraries can of course be altered in any way that you wish, and our knowledgeable sales consultants will be only too happy to advise you on creating the ultimate Sri Lanka wildlife holiday.</p>

      <h3>Horton Plains National Park</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="p">Horton Plains National Park (Sinhala: හෝර්ටන් තැන්න ජාතික උද්‍යානය, romanized: Hortan Thanna Jathika Udyanaya) is a national park in the central highlands of Sri Lanka that was designated in 1988. It is located at an elevation of 2,100–2,300 m (6,900–7,500 ft) and encompasses montane grassland and cloud forest. It is rich in biodiversity and many species found here are endemic to the region. It is also a popular tourist destination and is situated 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from Ohiya, 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the world-famous Ohiya Gap/Dondra Watch and 32 kilometres (20 mi) from Nuwara Eliya.

        The Horton Plains are the headwaters of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains (මහ එළිය තැන්න). Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback is one of the major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a natural phenomenon.</p>

      <p class="p">Lunugamvehera National Park (Sinhala: ලුණුගම්වෙහෙර ජාතික වනෝද්‍යානය) in Sri Lanka was declared in 1995, with the intention of protecting the catchment area of the Lunugamvehera reservoir and wildlife of the area. The national park is an important habitat for water birds and elephants. The catchment area is vital to maintain the water levels of the five tanks in the down stream of Kirindi Oya and wetland characteristics of Bundala National Park.This national park also serves as a corridor for elephants to migrate between Yala National Park and Udawalawe National Park.The national park is situated 261 km (162 mi) southwest from Colombo. After being closed because of the Sri Lankan civil war, the national park is now open to the general public.</p>
